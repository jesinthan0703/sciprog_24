Subject         : Scientific Programming
Week            : 8
Program Title   : GCD - Iterative & Recursive

Steps to execute:
    Clone this repository -> open practical8 folder and open it in terminal
    
 To Execute `gcdIterative.c`
        1. Type the following `gcc gcdIterative.c` -> This compiles the program using gcc compiler
        2. The compiled file a.out will be created.
        3. Type `./a.out` to run the compiled file.
        4. If successfully executed, the user will be asked to enter two integers.
        5. The gcd will be calculated in iterative method and the GCD for the two integers will be printed.

 To Execute `gcdRecursive.c`
        1. Type the following `gcc gcdRecursive.c` -> This compiles the program using gcc compiler
        2. The compiled file a.out will be created.
        3. Type `./a.out` to run the compiled file.
        4. If successfully executed, the user will be asked to enter two integers.
        5. The gcd will be calculated in recursive method and the GCD for the two integers will be printed.
