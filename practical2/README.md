Program Title   : Conversion (binary digit) and Summation

Steps to execute:
    Clone this repository -> open practical2 folder and open it in terminal
    
    To Execute `conversion.c`
        1. Type the following `gcc conversion.c` -> This compiles the program using gcc compiler
        2. The compiled file a.out will be created.
        3. Type `./a.out` to run the compiled file.
        4. If successfully executed, the user will be asked to enter an integer.
        5. The integer will be transformed into binary and it will be printed
    To Execute `sum.c`
        1. Type the following `gcc sum.c` -> This compiles the program using gcc compiler
        2. The compiled file a.out will be created.
        3. Type `./a.out` to run the compiled file.
        4. If successfully executed, the sum of the series will be calculated from both the directions.
        5. The two sums will be printed and its difference will also be printed.
