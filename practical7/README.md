Program Title   : Find e estimates & Work with pointers

Steps to execute:
    Clone this repository -> open practical7 folder and open it in terminal
    
 To Execute `pointers.c`
        1. Type the following `gcc pointers.c` -> This compiles the program using gcc compiler
        2. The compiled file a.out will be created.
        3. Type `./a.out` to run the compiled file.
        4. If successfully executed, the user will be asked to enter a size for the array.
        5. The array elements will be populated by 1s and the memory space will be freed after execution.

 To Execute `getE.c`
        1. Type the following `gcc getE.c -lm` -> This compiles the program using gcc compiler. lm is used to include the math library.
        2. The compiled file a.out will be created.
        3. Type `./a.out` to run the compiled file.
        4. If successfully executed, the estimates and error values will be printed.
